# 🌞 Sun Tracking Solar Panel Project 🌞

## 📜 Overview

This project showcases a solar panel system that **tracks the sun's movement** to optimize energy collection. The system utilizes an **ESP32 microcontroller**, light-dependent resistors (LDRs) calibrated via a voltage divider, and a user-friendly web interface to display current power and total energy stored since operation began. 

**Selected for Open House Event at IIT Delhi on November 4, 2023** 🎉

1. **Light Detection**: The LDRs measure sunlight intensity and adjust the solar panel's orientation to maximize exposure. ☀️
2. **Calibration**: A voltage divider circuit calibrates the LDRs, ensuring accurate readings of light intensity.
3. **Data Monitoring**: The ESP32 hosts a simple web interface that displays:
   - Current power output ⚡
   - Total energy accumulated since the project commenced 📊
4. **Automation**: The system automatically adjusts the panel's angle based on real-time data from the LDRs.
